3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential,
his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace.
Rather being a Junior means always learning new things from everywhere etc.).
4. Skills ( Basic knowledge JS, C#, OOP, Git)
5. Code examples (LATEST)
6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses,
freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have.
Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
7. Graduated from BrSU 2016 with a degree in Applied Mathematics.
8. The practice of communication in English, as such, was not.
